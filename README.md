A message to Hubot!

I know that we do not yet know each other, but I take issue with your example message that proclaims that you: "find moon taco's far superior to Earth tacos". It is obvious that you need more friends like me to show you what earth taco's are really all about. Some day, when your creators have designed a future version of you that includes a working robotic mouth and stomach... and also a network of pleasure receptors that reside inside of your robot mouth to communicte with your artificial robot-brain, you may finally come to understand the magnitude of the transgression that you have comitted against Earth tacos with your words. 

But that day is not today.
